# Advanced Neural Networks

For the purpose of self-developement multiple advanced deep neural network were investigated and some of them were personally tested. Moreover, group project was created entirely from scratch.

## Group Project - Variational Autoencoders
Project was completed together with Kacper Kubicki and can be accessed under [this link](Project_InterpolatingBetweenImages/GSN_2_KKubicki_PLewandowski.ipynb)

## Transformer

To view the transformer click [this link](Transformer/transformer.ipynb) or access the colab: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1puVl5hQkHIMA8DdrWz0K8zEL2WP6w3z4/view?usp=sharing

## GAN

Link to the working simple GAN click [this link](GAN/GSN2_lab_6_WorkingGAN.ipynb) or access the colab: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zJ0uoLclkqQ0XcrK3hB-8HtEq14VCjmK/view?usp=sharing

## DCGAN CIFAR-10

To access the notebook click [this link](DCGAN/GSN2_lab_6_DCGAN_CIFAR10.ipynb)

## HyperGAN

In [this directory](HyperGAN) there are outputs from HyperGAN training (sampled images and the model) as well as the .gif file presenting the training. Unfortunately, because of computational limitations the training could not be fully completed.
